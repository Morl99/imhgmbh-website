# Website for IMH GmbH

This website is created with the awesome [11ty](https://11ty.dev) and based on a starter project called [11ta](https://github.com/11ta/11ta-template) by [Shane Robinson](https://github.com/shanerobinson) for which I am really greatful, because it is always a lot easier to start a new project based on a working site, rather than an empty directory. The website is deployed to Netlify, which is just as awesome and makes developing and deploying websites a breeze.

I have created this website for a small company that is owned by my brother as a birthday gift, and you can regard it as a hobby project. Feel free to use it according to the MIT license.
